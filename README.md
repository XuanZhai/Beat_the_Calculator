# Beat_the_Calculator



## This is a 2D game created by Xuan(James) Zhai.
## Built with Unity 2D.
## Click "Beat the Calculator.exe" to start the game.

# Goal:
## In 100 sec, get the highest culmulative score.

# Control: 
## You can use either AWSD or UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT for move.
## You use ESC to pause the game if you want.
## You the game is finished, you can store your score with your name to the local file for record.

# Algo:
## If you have not got any number, you have to get a number before you get a symbol.
## When you got a symbol, you cannot get a symbol again since it violates the mathematical rules.
## On the other hand , when you got a number, you cannot get a number again until you got a symbol.
## You cannot let a number divide or mod by 0.

# Hint:
## Sometimes you will need to break your current number to get more symbols/numbers
## Since you cannot add your current score to the culmulative score until you get a "=" operator, the "=" operator may
## sometimes become scarce and valuable.

# MOST IMPORTANT THING: JUST ENJOY THE GAME!!!
