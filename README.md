Built with Unity 2D.\n
Click "Beat the Calculator.exe" to start the game.\n

### Goal:
In 100 sec, get the highest culmulative score.

### Control: 
You can use either AWSD or UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT for move.\n
You use ESC to pause the game if you want.\n
You the game is finished, you can store your score with your name to the local file for record.\n

### Algo:
If you have not got any number, you have to get a number before you get a symbol.\n
When you got a symbol, you cannot get a symbol again since it violates the mathematical rules.\n
On the other hand , when you got a number, you cannot get a number again until you got a symbol.\n
You cannot let a number divide or mod by 0.\n

### Hint:
Sometimes you will need to break your current number to get more symbols/numbers. \n
Since you cannot add your current score to the culmulative score until you get a "=" operator, the "=" operator may
sometimes become scarce and valuable.\n

## MOST IMPORTANT THING: JUST ENJOY THE GAME!!!
